# CAN PyTorch (Work in Progress)

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Compositional Attention Network architecture introduced in the recent ICLR 2018 paper:
> [Drew A. Hudson, Christopher D. Manning. "Compositional attention networks
for machine reasoning." *International Conference on
Learning Representations*, 2018.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03067)

This implementation is focused on exploring and re-producing the general characteristics of the architecture.
